# TaskTracker

This is a simple task tracker application made by following the tutorial video "Angular Crash Course" by Traversy Media on YouTube. It allows the user to Create, Read, Update (set or unset reminder for a task), and Delete tasks. It uses json-server to run a server locally from a db.json file in order to remember any changes made.


## AngularCrash

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests
